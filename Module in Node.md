# Modules in Node
Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.  
A set of functions you want to include in your application.

### There are three types of modules in Node js
* Core modules
* Local modules
* Third party modules
#### Core Modules
1. **dns**	To do DNS lookups and name resolution functions  
2. **domain**	Deprecated. To handle unhandled errors  
3. **events**	To handle events  
4. **fs**	To handle the file system  
5. **http**	To make Node.js act as an HTTP server  
6. **https**	To make Node.js act as an HTTPS server  
7. **net**	To create servers and clients  
8. **os**	Provides information about the operation system  
#### Local Modules
Local modules are modules created locally in your Node.js application. These modules include different functionalities of 
your application in separate files and folders. You can also package it and distribute it via NPM, so that Node.js community 
can use it. For example, if you need to connect to MongoDB and fetch data then you can create a module for it, which can be 
reused in your application.
#### Third party modules
1. Express framework â€“ Express is a minimal and flexible Node js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for the web and Mobile applications.
2. Socket.io - Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. This module is good for creation of chatting based applications.
3. Jade - Jade is a high-performance template engine and implemented with JavaScript for node and browsers.
4. MongoDB - The MongoDB Node.js driver is the officially supported node.js driver for MongoDB.
5. Restify - restify is a lightweight framework, similar to express for building REST APIs
6. Bluebird - Bluebird is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance
